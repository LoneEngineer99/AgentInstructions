# Project Copilot Instructions — Agent Guide

> **Purpose:** This document is the **single source of truth** for AI coding agents working on this project. It extends the base instructions with project-specific context. Read both this file and the base instructions fully before every task. Keep this file up to date after every major modification. **Continue working until the problem is completely solved.** Before performing any task, briefly list the sub-steps you intend to follow.

---

## ⚠️ Base Instructions Reference

**You MUST read and follow the base instructions document before starting any task.**

The base instructions are maintained in the [Angent Instructions repository](https://github.com/LoneEngineer99/AgentInstructions) and should **always be read from there by URL** — never copied into individual projects. Fetch and read the latest version from:

> **Raw URL:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoneEngineer99/AgentInstructions/main/base-copilot-instructions.md`

If you are working inside the Starter Kit repository itself, you may read the file locally at `.github/base-copilot-instructions.md`.

### Rules for Base Instructions

1. **ALWAYS fetch and read** the base instructions from the URL above at the start of every task.
2. **ALWAYS follow** all rules, conventions, principles, and standards defined in the base instructions.
3. **NEVER copy** `base-copilot-instructions.md` into your project — always reference it by URL from the Starter Kit repository.
4. **NEVER modify** `base-copilot-instructions.md` — it is a shared document used across multiple projects.
5. **If this file (`copilot-instructions.md`) conflicts with the base instructions**, this file takes precedence — project-specific overrides win.
6. **All project-specific customizations, overrides, and context** belong in this file, not in the base instructions.
7. **When the base instructions say to "update this guide"**, it means update **this file** (`copilot-instructions.md`), never the base file.

# 🚀 NEW PROJECT INITIALIZATION

> **⚠️ CRITICAL — READ THIS FIRST**: This section is for **new projects only**. If this is your first time working on a project based on this Starter Kit template, you **MUST** complete the initialization process below before starting any development work. **Delete this entire section** once project initialization is complete and the Project Context & Architecture section is fully populated.

## Purpose

This Starter Kit is a template designed to be adapted for various types of projects. Before you begin development, you need to gather comprehensive information about the specific project you're building to properly configure the development environment and documentation.

## Initialization Protocol

### Step 2: Document the Answers

Create a temporary working document with all answers. You can use:
- A temporary markdown file in `/tmp/project-init-answers.md`
- A structured note in the conversation
- A shared document with the stakeholder

### Step 3: Populate the Project Context & Architecture Section

Using the answers from Step 1, systematically fill in the sections below:

#### 3.1: Update Project Overview

```markdown
**[Project Name]** — [Brief description from Q2]

| Component | Path | Purpose | Tech Stack |
|-----------|------|---------|------------|
| **[Component from Q5]** | `path/` | [Purpose] | [Technologies] |
```

- Use answers from Q1, Q2, Q3, Q5 to fill this section
- Create a table row for each major component/module

#### 3.2: Update Repository Structure

```
ProjectRoot/
├── .github/
│   └── copilot-instructions.md        # Project-specific instructions (this file)
├── [backend-directory]/      # Based on Q9
├── [frontend-directory]/     # Based on Q9
├── [tests-directory]/        # Based on Q9, Q12
└── README.md
```

> **Note:** `base-copilot-instructions.md` is NOT copied into the project. It is always read by URL from the Starter Kit repository (see [Base Instructions Reference](#-base-instructions-reference)).

- Use answers from Q9 to define the actual folder structure
- Be specific based on the chosen architecture

#### 3.3: Update Architecture Patterns

Document the actual architecture based on Q5, Q6, Q14:
- Layer separation strategy
- Dependency injection approach
- Model architecture (database → domain → DTO)
- API design patterns

#### 3.4: Update Build & Run Commands

Fill in with actual commands from Q11:

```bash
# Install dependencies
[actual command]

# Build
[actual command]

# Run (development)
[actual command]

# Run (production)
[actual command]

# Test
[actual command]

# Lint
[actual command]
```

#### 3.5: Update Database Schema & Migrations

Document based on Q14, Q15:
- Schema location
- Migration tool and commands
- Seeding strategy
- Backup approach

#### 3.6: Update Site Templates & Design References

Based on the user's answers to Q19 (HTML templates):
- Document any HTML/CSS template sources (name, path, and purpose)
- Link to design systems or style guides
- Note branding assets location
- **Store each template source as a GitHub memory** using the `store_memory` tool, including the template name, path, and purpose in each memory entry

#### 3.7: Update Current Implementation Status

Fill in the implementation phases based on Q4, Q21:

```markdown
**Phase: Initial Setup**

#### Completed
- Project initialization
- [Other setup tasks]

#### In Progress
- [Current sprint/phase work from Q21]

#### Planned
- [Future features from Q4]
```

### Step 4: Update Project README

Based on the initialization answers, update `/README.md` with:
- Project name and description (Q1, Q2)
- Key features (Q3)
- Technology stack (Q5)
- Getting started guide (Q11)
- Contribution guidelines
- License information
- Contact information (Q22)

### Step 5: Create Project Setup Checklist

Create a comprehensive setup checklist for new developers:

```markdown
## Developer Setup

- [ ] Clone repository
- [ ] Install prerequisites: [list from Q5, Q11]
- [ ] Install dependencies: [command from Q11]
- [ ] Configure environment variables: [list based on Q5, Q16]
- [ ] Initialize database: [steps from Q14]
- [ ] Run migrations: [command from Q14]
- [ ] Seed test data: [command from Q14]
- [ ] Run tests to verify setup: [command from Q11]
- [ ] Start development server: [command from Q11]
```

### Step 6: GitHub Copilot Agent — Memory Initialization

> **⚠️ CRITICAL — AGENT ONLY**: This step applies **exclusively** when the project is being initialized by the GitHub Copilot Agent (or any AI agent with access to the `store_memory` tool). Human developers may skip this step.

When the GitHub Copilot Agent is running this initialization, it **MUST** store at least **30 GitHub memories** using the `store_memory` tool so that it (and future agent sessions) can quickly reference key project context without re-reading entire files. These memories serve as a fast-access knowledge base that persists across agent sessions.

#### What to Store as Memories

Memories should comprehensively cover the following categories. Aim for **at least 30 distinct memories** distributed across these areas:

**From `copilot-instructions.md` (this file) — at least 8 memories:**
1. Project name, description, and primary purpose
2. Technology stack (backend, frontend, database, APIs)
3. Authentication and authorization strategy
4. Repository structure and key directory paths
5. Build, run, and test commands
6. Database schema location and migration strategy
7. Current implementation status and phase
8. Any project-specific overrides or rules

**From `base-copilot-instructions.md` — at least 10 memories:**
1. Core identity and execution protocol (§1–§2)
2. TODO management and context maintenance rules (§3)
3. Error debugging protocols (§4)
4. Key software engineering principles enforced (§8–§11)
5. Separation of concerns and i18n rules (§12)
6. Security and defensive programming rules (§13)
7. Code formatting and documentation standards (§14)
8. Unit testing requirements and patterns (§15)
9. Naming conventions for the project's primary language(s) (§16–§22)
10. Post-task reporting and update requirements (§26–§27)

**From `roadmap.md` — at least 5 memories:**
1. Overall project vision and goals
2. Current phase and milestone status
3. Completed features and components
4. Upcoming planned work items
5. Known blockers or dependencies

**From `README.md` and general project context — at least 7 memories:**
1. Project overview and key features
2. Getting started / setup instructions
3. Contribution guidelines or team conventions
4. External integrations and third-party services
5. Design system, branding, or template references
6. Deployment and environment configuration
7. Any domain-specific terminology or business rules

#### Memory Storage Guidelines

- Each memory should be a **clear, concise, actionable fact** (under 200 characters — this is a `store_memory` tool constraint)
- Include accurate **citations** (file path and line numbers) for each memory
- Use descriptive **subjects** (e.g., "tech stack", "build commands", "auth strategy")
- Provide a **reason** explaining why the memory is useful for future tasks
- Categorize appropriately: use `general` for cross-cutting facts, `file_specific` for file-bound details, `bootstrap_and_build` for build/run info, and `user_preferences` for stated preferences

#### Example Memories

```
Subject: "tech stack"
Fact: "Backend uses ASP.NET Core 8 with Dapper for MySQL; frontend uses Razor Pages with Bootstrap 5."
Category: general
Citations: .github/copilot-instructions.md:<line range of Project Overview section>

Subject: "build commands"  
Fact: "Build with 'dotnet build', run with 'dotnet run --project src/Web', test with 'dotnet test'."
Category: bootstrap_and_build
Citations: .github/copilot-instructions.md:<line range of Build & Run Commands section>

Subject: "roadmap status"
Fact: "Phase 1 (Core Setup) complete; Phase 2 (User Management) in progress; Phase 3 (Dashboard) planned."
Category: general
Citations: .github/roadmap.md:<line range of current status>
```

### Step 7: Remove This Section

Once you have:
- ✅ Asked all discovery questions
- ✅ Documented all answers
- ✅ Updated all project-specific sections with actual information
- ✅ Updated README.md
- ✅ Created developer setup instructions
- ✅ Stored at least 30 GitHub memories (if running as a GitHub Copilot Agent)
- ✅ Verified all placeholders are replaced with actual information

**DELETE this entire "NEW PROJECT INITIALIZATION" section** from this file — everything between the `# 🚀 NEW PROJECT INITIALIZATION` heading and the `# Project Context & Architecture` heading.

**Update the Table of Contents** to remove the reference to this section.

**Commit the changes** with a message like: "Complete project initialization for [Project Name]"
